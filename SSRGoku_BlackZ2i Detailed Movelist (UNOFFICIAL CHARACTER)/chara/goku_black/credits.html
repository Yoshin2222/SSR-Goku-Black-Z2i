                                        I am not a Team Z2 dev, nor have i ever claimed to be, i simply made this movelist 
                                        as a fun nod to how official characters have them, whilst giving people who enjoy Black a way to better
                                        learn all about him. That being said, thank you for downloading him, and another thanks to everyone listed.
                                        Have fun, and please report back to me if you find any bugs, or have any contributions/suggestions such as 
                                        palletes, criticism, move ideas, sprites, etc. Most importantly, have fun, and enjoy!</div>

					<!-- Move Description -->
					<div class="col-lg-12">Pretty unusual, but i felt like including this anyway. To everyone here and more, thank you for paying me any heed at all. In all sincerity, i started making this dude out of laziness, no genuine love for the character. Still have none. That being said, programming him has been such a great learning experience in loads of ways. Hearing people say they will keep him even when the official Black is released genuinely puts a smile on my face, that in some way or another my practice is really appreciated. That being said, this version of Black is conclusively done. No more new moves, no massive updates, nothing after this. Bugfixes are all you can ever ask of me now. For the last time, thank you so much for downloading the character, and i really hope you have fun with him! Weird to think he took up 38,174 lines of code, discounting stuff like constants, varlist and the anim data. If working on this character has taught me anything, it's that anybody can learn Mugen</div>
